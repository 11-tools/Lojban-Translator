It is sometimes mistakenly called "antbear", "anteater", or the "Cape anteater" after 
the Cape of Good Hope. The name comes from the Afrikaans/Dutch for "earth pig" 
or "ground pig" (aarde earth/ground, varken pig), because of its burrowing habits 
(similar origin to the name groundhog). The aardvark is not related to the pig; 
rather, it is the sole recent representative of the obscure 
mammalian order Tubulidentata, in which it is usually considered to form one 
variable species of the genus Orycteropus, the sole surviving genus in the 
family Orycteropodidae. The aardvark is not closely related to the South 
American anteater, despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial 
resemblance. The closest living relatives of the aardvark are the elephant shrews, 
along with the sirenians, hyraxes, tenrecs, andelephants. The main character 
of Arthur, an animated television series for children produced by WGBH, shown in 
more than 180 countries, is an aardvark. [Note that a pig is not the same animal as
an aardvark.]
